# ♟️ The project 

Consists in the implementation of a ML model that's able to predict the result of a chess match given its parameters. It's based on a dataset published on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess), which has a compilation of matches played on lichess.org from 2013 to 2017.

# ♟️ The models

For now, we have implemented:

- Random Forest
  - _eda-chess-matches-random-forest.ipynb_: contains an analysis of the data with a first Random Forest model.
  - _chess-matches-random-forest-improved.ipynb_: contains an improved Random Forest model.
  - _compiled-random-forest.ipynb_: is the **final model**, please refer to this file to look at the compiled version.
